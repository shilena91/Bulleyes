# Bulleyes

My first iOS app that I learned from raywenderlich.com. Bulleyes is just a simple app that asks user to target a certain value by using slide bar. The more accurate user reachs the more points they get. This project taught me first basic steps in iOS develop's environment e.g xcode, create UI interfaces, some basics swift codes.
